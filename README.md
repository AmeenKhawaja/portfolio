# README
- A portfolio website I've created to learn HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript in my spare time.
- It can be found here at: https://ameenkhawaja.github.io/portfolio/

# Design Choice
- I personally enjoy looking at bland colours as it goes easy on my eyes
- For my website, I decided to go with a more "minimalist" approach meaning I did not include too many bright gradient-colours, designs, photos, etc (personal preference)
